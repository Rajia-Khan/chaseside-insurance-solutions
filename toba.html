        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">The Financial Conduct Authority</h2>
        <p>The Financial Conduct Authority is the independent watchdog that regulates financial services.</p>
        <p>Chaseside Insurance Solutions Limited is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Our FCA
            register number is 308487 and you can check our status at <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/register"
                target="_blank" class="text-teal font-bold">www.fca.org.uk/register</a> or by contacting the FCA on 0845
            606
            1234.</p>
        <p>Our permitted business includes advising, arranging, dealing in and assisting with the placing and
            administration of all types of General Insurance policies.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Privacy Policy & General Data Protection Regulations</h2>
        <p>We have a Privacy Policy which can be viewed within our Compliance and Important Information Pack and also on
            our Website at <a href="https://www.chasesidebrokers.co.uk" target="_blank"
                class="text-teal font-bold">www.chasesidebrokers.co.uk</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Our Service</h2>
        <p>We are an independent insurance intermediary, who acts on our customers’ behalf in arranging insurance. We
            will
            advise you separately prior to the commencement of each contract if this alters. Our services include:
            advising
            you on your insurance needs; arranging your insurance cover with insurers to meet your requirements; and
            helping
            you with any ongoing changes you need to make. As part of the service, we will assist you with any claim you
            need
            to make and tell you what your responsibilities are in relation to making claims. If you mislay your policy
            at
            any time, we will issue a replacement policy document, if you request it.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Whose products we offer</h2>
        <p>We usually offer advice from a range of insurers, representing a fair analysis of the market, however, under
            certain circumstances we may only deal with a limited panel, or single insurer. There may also be occasions
            where
            we recommend a product from an insurer with whom we hold a Delegated Underwriting Authority. In these cases
            we
            act as agent of the insurer and in all cases we will confirm, for each individual policy we provide you
            with, the
            basis of our advice. In certain circumstances we will use the services of another intermediary to place your
            insurance and in these circumstances we will advise you of this fact together with confirmation of the name
            of
            the risk carrier in the form of “underwritten by”.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">The service we will provide you with</h2>
        <p>We will advise and make a recommendation for you after we have assessed your demands and needs. Our advice
            will
            be confirmed in a demands & needs and suitability statement, giving reasons for our recommendation. In
            respect of
            Legal Expenses/Motor Breakdown policies you will not receive advice or a recommendation from us and you will
            then
            need to make your own choice about how to proceed. When a policy falls due for renewal, we will review the
            terms
            offered by your current insurer and if in our opinion and experience, these terms remain competitive, we
            will not
            automatically carry out a full market review of your policy. If a full market review is carried out, this
            will be
            confirmed to you in writing.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">What you will pay for our services</h2>
        <p>We usually receive a commission from the insurer with whom we place your business. We also receive commission
            for
            arranging finance agreements for the payment of premiums and we may also receive commission or fees for
            passing
            introductions to other professionals. In addition, we normally make the following charges to cover the
            administration of your insurance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arranging new policies/renewal/mid term adjustment:</strong> £ 00</li>
            <li><strong>Mid term cancellations and other refunds:</strong> refunded NET of commission. We may, in
                addition, charge a £ 00 administration fee.</li>
            <li><strong>Replacement/duplicate certificates or cover notes:</strong> £ 10</li>
            <li><strong>Payment by Credit Cards:</strong> £ 00 (We do not accept American Express)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Personal lines/Retail policies cancelled during the ‘Right to Cancel’ period will be subject to an
            administration
            charge of £25, in addition to the premium charged by the insurer for the period of cover provided.</p>
        <p>Occasionally we may arrange a policy on which we earn no commission (a ‘net-premium policy’) and in these
            cases
            we will advise you of the arrangement fee before you take the policy out. Specific charges, which apply to
            individual policies will be advised to you prior to the commencement of each contract applicable to that
            policy.
            The specific charge and purpose of any additional charges will always be advised to you in advance.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">What to do if you have a complaint</h2>
        <p>Our aim is to provide a first class service, however, if you wish to register a complaint, please contact us
            by
            writing to Carin Johnson, Complaints Manager, Chaseside Insurance Solutions Ltd, Unit 4 Maxwell Road,
            Borehamwood, WD6 1JN or, by phone Telephone 0203 096 2830.</p>
        <p>We will provide you with a copy of our full complaints procedure and respond to you promptly. We will keep
            you
            informed of the progress of your complaint and aim to make a final response to you within eight weeks, or
            keep you
            informed as to why this is not possible. In the event that your complaint relates to activities or services
            provided by another party, we will ensure that your complaint is appropriately forwarded in writing, and
            will
            track the progress of the complaint and responses of that party.</p>
        <p>After our final response has been issued, if you still cannot settle your complaint with us, you may be
            entitled
            to refer it to the Financial Ombudsman Service, for an independent assessment and opinion.</p>
        <p>The FOS Consumer Helpline is on 0845 080 1800 and their address is:</p>
        <p class="italic text-gray-700">Financial Ombudsman Service<br>
            South Quay Plaza,<br>
            183 Marsh Wall,<br>
            London,<br>
            E14 9SR</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Your Right to Cancel (Applicable to Consumer customers only)</h2>
        <p>You have a legal right to cancel your policy for any reason, subject to no claims having occurred, within 14
            days of receiving the full terms & conditions. You will always be advised where this Right applies. A charge
            will
            apply for the period of cover provided and, in addition, we make an administration charge as detailed above.
        </p>
        <p>If you wish to cancel a policy you must advise us in writing, prior to expiry of the 14-day cancellation
            period,
            to our usual office address.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Are we covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS)?
        </h2>
        <p>We are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). You may be entitled to compensation from
            the
            FSCS if we cannot meet our obligations. This depends on the type of business and the circumstances of the
            claim.
            Full details and further information are available from the FSCS.. The FSCS is the UK’s statutory fund of
            last
            resort for customers of authorised financial services firms, like ourselves. The FSCS can pay compensation
            if an
            authorised firm is unable or likely to be unable to pay claims against it, usually because it has gone out
            of
            business or is insolvent.</p>
        <p>Insurance advising and arranging is covered for 90% of the claim without an upper limit. For compulsory
            insurances (for example, motor insurance and employers’ liability insurance), insurance advising and
            arranging is
            covered for 100% of the claim, without an upper limit. Further information about compensation scheme
            arrangements is available from the FSCS.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Payment Options</h2>
        <p>We normally accept payment by guaranteed cheque or the following credit/debit cards – Visa, MasterCard,
            Maestro.
            You may be able to spread your payments through insurers’ instalment schemes or a credit scheme, which we
            have
            arranged with an established insurance premium finance provider. We will give you full information about
            your
            payment options and the appropriate finance agreement when we discuss your insurance in detail.</p>
        <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Your policy cover will cease if you fail to keep up payments on an instalment
            agreement or premium finance facility related to it.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Language Used</h2>
        <p>The English language will be used for all communications, the contractual terms and conditions, and any
            information we are required to supply to you, before and during the duration of the contract.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Information on how we treat Payments You make to Us</h2>
        <p>Under the terms of our agreements with the Insurance companies with whom we place business, we normally
            receive
            premiums you pay to us as Agent of the Insurer, where you have the additional protection of insurance
            companies
            accepting that monies paid to us are treated as being received by them (Risk Transfer) This premium is paid
            into
            a Non Statutory Insurer Money Account.. All other insurance premiums you pay to us are protected in a
            Statutory
            Trust Client Account until we pay insurers. We do not pay any interest on premiums held by us in the course
            of
            arranging and administering your insurance.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-6">Your Duty to Give Information (Fair Presentation of Risk)</h2>
        <p>It is your responsibility to provide complete and accurate information to insurers when you take out your
            insurance policy, throughout the life of your policy, and when you renew your insurance. It is important
            that you
            ensure that all statements you make on proposal forms, statements of fact, claim forms and other documents
            are
            full and accurate. Please note that if you fail to disclose any information or change in circumstances to
            your
            insurers which could influence the cost, or their decision to accept your insurance, this could invalidate
            your
            insurance cover.</p>
